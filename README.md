# What is the Datapool Manager?
The datapool manager is a tool-agnostic utility for handling test data for load testing. It was based off the functionality provided by JMeter's Simple Table Server plugin, but built as a standalone program. This means you can have your test data hosted and running 24/7 and utilised by different load testing tools.

## Key functionality
The Datapool Manager (DPM) provides:
- Sequential and random access of records
- Creating test data on the fly
- Consumable data (records that can only be used once)

It is built to be high performing and reliable.
